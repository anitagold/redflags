## About the project

The *Red Flags* project aims to enhance the transparency of public procurements in Hungary and **support the fight against corrupt procurements**. It provides an interactive tool that allows the monitoring of procurement processes and their implementation by citizens, journalists or even public officials and catch fraud risks at different stages of the procurement process. The *Red Flags* tool automatically checks procurement documents from the [Tenders Electronic Daily (TED)](http://ted.europa.eu/) and **filters risky procurements** through a special algorithm. Although risky does not mean corrupt, flagged procurement documents are worth checking. Users can subscribe to receive alerts if risky procurements are published (generally or in their special field of interest).

The *Red Flags* is a common project of [K-Monitor](http://www.k-monitor.hu/), [PetaByte](http://petabyte-research.org/) and [Transparency International Hungary](http://transparency.hu/), with the support of the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/). The views expressed on the website do not necessarily reflect the views of the European Union.

## Technical overview


### What it does

<i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> **Downloads data** - Runs through the notices available on *TED* and downloads them.

<i class="fa fa-cog"></i> **Processes data** - Parses the raw input, creates a model, analyzes it with indicators to generate flags.

<i class="fa fa-database"></i> **Stores data** - Stores the parsed and generated information to be available for further operations.

<i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> **Serves data** - Sends subscription emails and displays stored data on the website.

The whole process (downloading, processing, storing fresh notices, sending subscriptions and updating the website) is done once **every day**.


### About the input data

The data into *Red Flags* is coming from *TED*. The documents of public procurements are called *notices*, they have a *Data* tab with a metadata table and they have the document tab which contains the details of the procurement in text blocks. Most of the information is only available in the original language of the tender.

We spent a lot of time analyzing these documents and testing our parser manually and we can say that the input **data itself can contain errors**.

Also, because most of the data must be parsed from not well-formatted text paragraphs, the **parsing is quite difficult**. We are using as many search and exclude patterns as we can, but there can be some places where our parser can fail to give correct output.

Because of these experiences, we recommend you to **check the original document** too on *TED*, the website shows a button on every notice page.
